Software Engineer

About
-------------------
Having started my career working on small dynamic projects 8 years ago,
I've extended my expertise to developing RIA's on enterprise level, using MVC
frameworks and design patterns. For possibility to develop and maintain all
application’s layers I started using Python 4 years ago and now it is my
mostly used programming language. Web development was always my main priority
so I’m skilled in using HTML/CSS/JS stack and experienced in working with
Django and Flask. Participation in OpenStack global community is one of the
greatest challenges in my professional experience. Some of my strengths are:
flexibility, in-depth research, willingness to learn and use new technologies.
